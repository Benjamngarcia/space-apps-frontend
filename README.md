# Aeros - Air Quality Intelligence Platform

Aeros is a web platform developed for the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025, focused on monitoring and visualizing real-time air quality across the United States. Our goal is to empower people to make informed decisions about their health and daily activities, using open data, artificial intelligence, and a friendly user experience.

## 🚀 Features

- **Interactive map:** Visualize air quality by state and zip code, with updated data categorized by pollutant (NO2, O3, CH2O, PM).
- **Personalized recommendations:** Receive suggestions for safe activities, indoor alternatives, and alerts, tailored to your interests and health conditions.
- **User profile:** Manage your account, set notifications and preferences to receive relevant information.
- **Intelligent analysis:** Our AI processes historical and current data to provide insights and predictions about air quality.
- **Multiplatform access:** Available on any device, with a modern and responsive interface.
- **Robust backend:** Node.js API integrated with AWS S3 for efficient data and CSV file management.
- **Next.js frontend:** Fast and scalable application, with dynamic visualizations and reusable components.

## 🏆 Challenge

NASA’s Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution (TEMPO) mission is revolutionizing air quality monitoring across North America by enabling better forecasts and reducing pollutant exposure. Your challenge is to develop a web-based app that forecasts air quality by integrating real-time TEMPO data with ground-based air quality measurements and weather data, notifying users of poor air quality, and helping to improve public health decisions. Teams are encouraged to utilize new technologies that allow seamless scaling of computing from local devices to cloud systems, enhancing collaboration and streamlining work efficiency.
